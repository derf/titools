Tools related to the Texas Instruments TI8x calculators

Right now this only contains 'tibtoa' (TI Basic to ASCII), which will read
the binary TI8x files and dump their contents. Note that it's not really
ASCII - Most of the calculator's characters are displayed in Unicode.

tibtoa has been tested with files dumped by tilp.
